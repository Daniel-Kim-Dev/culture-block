In early British Columbia, such occasions were often marked by firing cannons, ringing bells, and three hearty cheers. But another form of recognition was used in BC and other places as well the firing of anvils! The firing of anvils as a form of salute has a long history. In BC they frequently welcomed the arrival of a new stern wheel steamboat. Here and in other places they marked special days and festivities. The process involves placing a little gunpowder between two anvils and igniting it. In the resulting explosion, the top anvil flies upward, a lot of smoke surrounds the park, and the noise is similar to cannon fire. In the late 1800s, a group of men in New Westminster fired an anvil salute to the sovereign when other more recognized means were not available. That annual salute, continued from that time until today, is now carried out by the renowned Ancient and Honourable Hyack Anvil Battery, to mark Victoria Day in honour of the reigning monarch and the memory of Queen Victoria. The salute has also been fired on special occasions such as a visit by Royalty, and the shots are always carried out in a formal, dignified manner as befits a proper salute. Don't miss this proud group in scarlet uniforms reminiscent of an early fire brigade, as they proudly continue an important part of the local cultural heritage and history.",

A musical employs brilliant swirls of colour, light and sound to tell timeless stories that are at once familiar and yet unique every night. Royal City Musical Theatre, hatched 1989 around a kitchen table in New Westminster, grew out of a love of music, theatre and dance - musical theatre.  It has been an enduring success, becoming one of the most popular musical theatre producers in Canada. They provide top flight entertainment thrilling large audiences while creating opportunities for performers, musicians and technicians to present their talents and develop their skills. They produce only large scale musicals with casts of as many as 60 on stage. Very few organizations outside of Broadway or London's West End are able to mount such enormous productions.  With a full sized orchestra, professional leads and large vocal and dance choruses, the scale and the jubilant spirit of RCMT productions are a feast for both the senses and for the heart. Each April, since 1990, RCMT produces a theatrically lavish and spirited production of a renowned musical theatre play.  Support RCMT by attending our shows and workshops, becoming a member, auditioning for a role or making a tax deductible charitable donation.  You won't regret getting to know RCMT better!",
